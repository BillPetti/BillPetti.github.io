I lead consulting for predictive modeling and data science at [Gallup](http://www.gallup.com/home.aspx). I also moonlight as a baseball researcher and consult for several Major League teams. My public work can be found at [The Hardball Times](http://www.hardballtimes.com/author/billpetti/). I have also developed a number of public tools for baseball analysis, such as the [baseballr package for R](https://BillPetti.github.io/baseballr), the [Interactive Spray Chart Tool](https://public.tableau.com/profile/billpetti#!/vizhome/SprayChartComparison/About), and the [Edge% app](https://billpetti.shinyapps.io/edge_shiny/).
