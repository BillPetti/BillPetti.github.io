Currently, I am a Director of Decision Sciences at [Maritz Motivation Solutions](https://www.maritzmotivation.com). Previously, I served as a Global Data Strategist and Subject Matter Expert for [Gallup](http://www.gallup.com/home.aspx). If you couldn't tell, I am a big fan of the [R programming language](https://cran.r-project.org). If you are looking for a crash course to get introduced to the language, you can find one [here](https://billpetti.github.io/Crash_course_in_R/).

I also moonlight as a baseball researcher and have consulted for several Major League teams. My public baseball research can mostly be found at [The Hardball Times](http://www.hardballtimes.com/author/billpetti/). 

I have also developed a number of public tools for baseball analysis, such as the [baseballr package for R](https://BillPetti.github.io/baseballr), the [Interactive Spray Chart Tool](https://billpetti.shinyapps.io/shiny_spraychart), and the [Edge% app](https://billpetti.shinyapps.io/edge_shiny/). For more information on these tools, visit the [Baseball Tools page](https://billpetti.github.io/baseball_tools_home/).
