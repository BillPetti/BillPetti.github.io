After the first day, my model was feeling pretty good about itself. It correctly picked 13/16 games, had the Loyola-Chicago upset, and had me in the top 6% in the [Google-Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/mens-machine-learning-competition-2018).

After the second day? Well...

While the earlier games pushed my Kaggle ranking to the top 3%, the evening upsets dropped me to top 40%. The model was correct 78% of the time when just considering win-no win for each game. It's three biggest misses included Marshall over Wichita St., Buffalo over Arizona, and, of course, UMBC over Virginia. UMBC pulled off the upset of the century, taking out Virginia and wrecking millions of brackets single-handedly. My model was as confident in a Virginia win as you could be (99.3%), and Vegas basically agreed (VA was -20).

There are a bunch of close games this weeked, starting with #1 Kansas versus #8 Seton Hall. The model has Kansas as a slight favorite, only giving 2.3 points. This is even tighter than Vegas, which has Kansas -4.5.

Only one matchup has the favorite greater than 90% to win, and that is Kansas St. However, they are playing...UMBC. We saw how well that worked out for Virginia.

Reminder: you can find all of the model's predictions for every possible matchup [here](https://rawgit.com/BillPetti/predicting-march-madness/master/ncaa_2018_mens_pred.html). These are based on all 68 teams that were selected for the tournament this year.
