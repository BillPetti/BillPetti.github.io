title: Accessing the MLB Stats API with baseballr (Video)
tags: [baseballr, rstats, r, mlb]

Decided to try something new and record a code through featuring some lesser known functions in the [baseballr](https://billpetti.github.io/baseballr/) package. The video foused on various functions for pulling data from MLB's offical stats API, including probable pitchers, batting orders, and non-pitch events like pick-offs and mound visits.

In the future I'll be posting additional videos to this channel: [Baseball Tools](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgdFDX6kjl14UaC6ak1ylJA)
